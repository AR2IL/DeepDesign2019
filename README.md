# Welcome to the code repository for ARCH 660/662, the Deep Design Studio
On this page you can find code that will allow you to explore different 2D-to-2D and 2D-to-3D image editing techniques, as well as collect simple datasets. Note that Paperspace is a cloud computing platform that allows you to access GPUs, which are necessary to run deep learning models efficiently. A tutorial on how to use the code in this repository with Paperspace is given in the following section.

Below are the links to the different tutorials in this repository. 

For step by step instructions on using Paperspace, please see the following:

[The Basics of Paperspace](paperspace_tutorials/Paperspace_basics.md)

[Uploading your dataset to and downloading your model outputs from Paperspace](paperspace_tutorials/Paperspace_uploadingdata.md)

[Running and training models using the Gradient Experiment Builder](paperspace_tutorials/Paperspace_usingExpBuilder.md)

To access the tutorials for how to run/train a variety of different models using the Paperspace Gradient Experiment Builder:
