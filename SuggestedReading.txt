Below is a list of papers that cover various aspects of what research has been done in the intersection of
Architecture, Art, and Artificial Intelligence, specifically deep learning. The majority of the works investigate how learned representations of neural networks can be used to edit and synthesize new images. 

(1) A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style
   https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
   This is the original style transfer paper that the Google 'Deep Style' Algorithm is based upon.

(2) Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf
    This is the original CycleGAN paper used for 'Domain Transfer', which can be thought of as transferring the 'style' of one     domain (captured by one dataset) to another domain (captured by a different dataset). In contrast to the Neural Style         transfer method proposed in (1), this method can only transfer style between these two domains.

(2) Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks
    https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html
    This is the blog post from Google describing the Deep Dream method.
  
(3) Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6034.pdf
    A nice example of this technique is given in https://rajpurkar.github.io/mlx/visualizing-cnns/
